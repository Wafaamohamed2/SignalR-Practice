### SignalR Real-Time Chat Application
  ## Project Overview:
   This is a comprehensive real-time chat application built with ASP.NET Core SignalR that demonstrates enterprise-level real-time communication features. 
   The application provides secure, scalable messaging capabilities with advanced features like group management, notifications, and connection tracking.

  ## Project Purpose:
   The application serves as both a production-ready chat solution and a learning resource for developers who want to understand how to implement real-time features using SignalR.
   It showcases best practices for:
      - Real-time web applications
      - JWT authentication with SignalR
      - Connection management at scale
      - Group-based messaging systems
      - Notification delivery systems
